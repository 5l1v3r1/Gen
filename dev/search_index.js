    "text": "Let\'s write a short Gen program that does Bayesian linear regression: given a set of points in the (x, y) plane, we want to find a line that fits them well.There are three main components to a typical Gen program.First, we define a generative model: a Julia function, extended with some extra syntax, that, conceptually, simulates a fake dataset. The model below samples slope and intercept parameters, and then for each of the x-coordinates that it accepts as input, samples a corresponding y-coordinate. We name the random choices we make with @addr, so we can refer to them in our inference program.using Gen\n\n@gen function my_model(xs::Vector{Float64})\n    slope = @addr(normal(0, 2), :slope)\n    intercept = @addr(normal(0, 10), :intercept)\n    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)\n        @addr(normal(slope * x + intercept, 1), \"y-$i\")\n    end\nendSecond, we write an inference program that implements an algorithm for manipulating the execution traces of the model. Inference programs are regular Julia code, and make use of Gen\'s standard inference library.The inference program below takes in a data set, and runs an iterative MCMC algorithm to fit slope and intercept parameters:function my_inference_program(xs::Vector{Float64}, ys::Vector{Float64}, num_iters::Int)\n    # Create a set of constraints fixing the \n    # y coordinates to the observed y values\n    constraints = DynamicAssignment()\n    for (i, y) in enumerate(ys)\n        constraints[\"y-$i\"] = y\n    end\n    \n    # Run the model, constrained by `constraints`,\n    # to get an initial execution trace\n    (trace, _) = initialize(my_model, (xs,), constraints)\n    \n    # Iteratively update the slope then the intercept,\n    # using Gen\'s default_mh operator.\n    slope_selection = select(:slope)\n    intercept_selection = select(:intercept)\n    for iter=1:num_iters\n        (trace, _) = default_mh(trace, slope_selection)\n        (trace, _) = default_mh(trace, intercept_selection)\n    end\n    \n    # From the final trace, read out the slope and\n    # the intercept.\n    assmt = get_assmt(trace)\n    return (assmt[:slope], assmt[:intercept])\nendFinally, we run the inference program on some data, and get the results:xs = [1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9., 10.]\nys = [8.23, 5.87, 3.99, 2.59, 0.23, -0.66, -3.53, -6.91, -7.24, -9.90]\n(slope, intercept) = my_inference_program(xs, ys, 1000)\nprintln(\"slope: $slope, intercept: $slope\")"

    "text": "Because inference programs are regular Julia code, users can use whatever visualization or plotting libraries from the Julia ecosystem that they want.

The code there is mostly the same as above, with a few small changes to incorporate an animated visualization of the inference process:It starts a visualization server and initializes a visualization before performing inference:# Start a visualization server on port 8000\nserver = VizServer(8000)\n\n# Initialize a visualization with some parameters\nviz = Viz(server, joinpath(@__DIR__, \"vue/dist\"), Dict(\"xs\" => xs, \"ys\" => ys, \"num\" => length(xs), \"xlim\" => [minimum(xs), maximum(xs)], \"ylim\" => [minimum(ys), maximum(ys)]))\n\n# Open the visualization in a browser\nopenInBrowser(viz)The \"vue/dist\" is a path to a custom trace renderer that draws the (x, y) points and the line represented by a trace; see the GenViz documentation for more details. The code for the renderer is here.It passes the visualization object into the inference program.(slope, intercept) = my_inference_program(xs, ys, 1000000, viz)In the inference program, it puts the current trace into the visualization at each iteration:for iter=1:num_iters\n    putTrace!(viz, 1, trace_to_dict(trace))\n    (trace, _) = default_mh(trace, slope_selection)\n    (trace, _) = default_mh(trace, intercept_selection)\nend"

Note that the built-in modeling language described in this section is only one of many ways of defining a generative function – generative functions can also be constructed using other embedded languages, or by directly implementing the methods of the generative function interface. However, the built-in modeling language is intended to being flexible enough cover a wide range of use cases and to use when learning the Gen programming model.In the remainder of this section, we refer to generative functions defined using the embedded modeling language as @gen functions."

Here, we give the Julia symbol address :z to a Bernoulli random choice.val::Bool = @addr(bernoulli(0.5), :z)Not all random choices need to be given addresses. An address is required if the random choice will be observed, or will be referenced by a custom inference algorithm (e.g. if it will be proposed to by a custom proposal distribution).It is recommended to ensure that the support of a random choice at a given address (the set of values with nonzero probability or probability density) is constant across all possible executions of the @gen function. This discipline will simplify reasoning about the probabilistic behavior of the function, and will help avoid difficult-to-debug NaNs or Infs from appearing. If the support of a random choice needs to change, consider using a different address for each distinct support."

A @gen function may have a fixed set of its arguments annotated with grad, which indicates that gradients with respect to that argument should be supported. For example, in the function below, we indicate that we want to support differentiation with respect to the y argument, but that we do not want to support differentiation with respect to the x argument.@gen function foo(x, (grad)(y))\n    if x > 5\n        @addr(normal(y, 1), :z)\n    else\n        @addr(normal(y, 10), :z)\n    end\nendBy default, the function being differentiated is the log probability (density) of the random choices. For the function foo above, when x > 5, the gradient with respect to y is the gradient of the log probability density of a normal distribution with standard deviation 1, with respect to its mean, evaluated at mean y. When x <= 5, we instead differentiate the log density of a normal distribution with standard deviation 10, relative to its mean.Gradients with respect to values of random choices. The author of a @gen function also identifies a set of addresses of random choices with respect to which they wish to support gradients of the log probability (density). Gradients of the log probability (density) with respect to the values of random choices are used in gradient-based numerical optimization of random choices, as well as certain MCMC updates that require gradient information.Gradients with respect to static parameters. The gradient of the log probability (density) with respect to the static parameters can also be computed using automatic differentiation. Currently, the log probability (density) must be a differentiable function of all static parameters.Gradients of a function of the return value. Differentiable programming in Gen composes across function calls. If the return value of the @gen function is conditionally dependent on source elements including (i) any arguments annotated with grad or (ii) any random choices for which gradients are supported, or (ii) any static parameters, then the gradient computation requires a gradient of the an external function with respect to the return value in order to the compute the correct gradients. Thus, the function being differentiated always includes a term representing the log probability (density) of all random choices made by the function, but can be extended with a term that depends on the return value of the function. The author of a @gen function can indicate that the return value depends on the source elements (causing the gradient with respect to the return value is required for all gradient computations) by adding the grad annotation to the @gen function itself. For example, in the function below, the return value is conditionally dependent (and actually identical to) on the random value at address :z:@gen function foo(x, (grad)(y))\n    if x > 5\n        @addr(normal(y, 1), :z)\n    else\n        @addr(normal(y, 10), :z)\n    end\nendIf the author of foo wished to support the computation of gradients with respect to the value of :z, they would need to add the grad annotation to foo using the following syntax:@gen (grad) function foo(x, (grad)(y))\n    if x > 5\n        @addr(normal(y, 1), :z)\n    else\n        @addr(normal(y, 10), :z)\n    end\nend"

Note that the procedures for differentiation of code described below are only performed during certain operations on @gen functions (backprop_trace and backprop_params).Julia code. Julia code used within a body of a @gen function is made differentiable using the ReverseDiff package, which implements  reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Specifically, values whose gradient is required (either values of arguments, random choices, or static parameters) are \'tracked\' by boxing them into special values and storing the tracked value on a \'tape\'. For example a Float64 value is boxed into a ReverseDiff.TrackedReal value. Methods (including e.g. arithmetic operators) are defined that operate on these tracked values and produce other tracked values as a result. As the computation proceeds all the values are placed onto the tape, with back-references to the parent operation and operands. Arithmetic operators, array and linear algebra functions, and common special numerical functions, as well as broadcasting, are automatically supported. See ReverseDiff for more details.Making random choices. When making a random choice, each argument is either a tracked value or not. If the argument is a tracked value, then the probability distribution must support differentiation of the log probability (density) with respect to that argument. Otherwise, an error is thrown. The has_argument_grads function indicates which arguments support differentiation for a given distribution (see Probability Distributions). If the gradient is required for the value of a random choice, the distribution must support differentiation of the log probability (density) with respect to the value. This is indicated by the has_output_grad function.Calling generative functions. Like distributions, generative functions indicate which of their arguments support differentiation, using the has_argument_grads function. It is an error if a tracked value is passed as an argument of a generative function, when differentiation is not supported by the generative function for that argument. If a generative function gen_fn has accepts_output_grad(gen_fn) = true, then the return value of the generative function call will be tracked and will propagate further through the caller @gen function\'s computation."

    "text": "The Static DSL supports a subset of the built-in modeling language. A static DSL function is identified by adding the static annotation to the function. For example:@gen (static) function foo(prob::Float64)\n    z1 = @addr(bernoulli(prob), :a)\n    z2 = @addr(bernoulli(prob), :b)\n    z3 = z1 || z2\n    return z3\nendAfter running this code, foo is a Julia value whose type is a subtype of StaticIRGenerativeFunction, which is a subtype of GenerativeFunction.The static DSL permits a subset of the syntax of the built-in modeling language. In particular, each statement must be one of the following forms:<symbol> = <julia-expr>\n<symbol> = @addr(<dist|gen-fn>(..),<symbol> [ => ..])\n@addr(<dist|gen-fn>(..),<symbol> [ => ..])\nreturn <symbol>Currently, static parameters are not supported in static DSL functions.Note that the @addr keyword may only appear in at the top-level of the right-hand-side expresssion. Also, addresses used with the @addr keyword must be a literal Julia symbol (e.g. :a). If multi-part addresses are used, the first component in the multi-part address must be a literal Julia symbol (e.g. :a => i is valid).Also, symbols used on the left-hand-side of assignment statements must be unique (this is called \'static single assignment\' (SSA) form) (this is called \'static single-assignment\' (SSA) form).Loading generated functions. Before a static DSL function can be invoked at runtime, Gen.load_generated_functions() method must be called. Typically, this call immediately preceeds the execution of the inference algorithm.Performance tips. For better performance, annotate the left-hand side of random choices with the type. This permits a more optimized trace data structure to be generated for the generative function. For example:@gen (static) function foo(prob::Float64)\n    z1::Bool = @addr(bernoulli(prob), :a)\n    z2::Bool = @addr(bernoulli(prob), :b)\n    z3 = z1 || z2\n    return z3\nend"

    "text": "The map combinator takes a generative function as input, and returns a generative function that applies the given generative function independently to a vector of arguments. The returned generative function has one argument with type Vector{T} for each argument of type T of the input generative function. The length of each argument, which must be the same for each argument, determines the number of times the input generative function is called (N). Each call to the input function is made under address namespace i for i=1..N. The return value of the returned function has type Vector{T} where T is the type of the return value of the input function. The map combinator is similar to the \'map\' higher order function in functional programming, except that the map combinator returns a new generative function that must then be separately applied.For example, consider the following generative function, which makes one random choice at address :z:@gen function foo(x::Float64, y::Float64)\n    @addr(normal(x + y, 1.0), :z)\nendWe apply the map combinator to produce a new generative function bar:bar = Map(foo)We can then obtain a trace of bar:xs = [0.0, 0.5]\nys = [0.5, 1.0]\n(trace, _) = initialize(bar, (xs, ys))This causes foo to be invoked twice, once with arguments (xs[1], ys[1]) in address namespace 1 and once with arguments (xs[2], ys[2]) in address namespace 2.

Generative functions implement the generative function interface, which is a set of methods that involve the execution traces and probabilistic behavior of generative functions. In the mathematical description of the interface methods, we denote arguments to a function by x, complete assignments of values to addresses of random choices (containing all the random choices made during some execution) by t and partial assignments by either u or v. We denote a trace of a generative function by the tuple (x t). We say that two assignments u and t agree when they assign addresses that appear in both assignments to the same values (they can different or even disjoint sets of addresses and still agree). A generative function is associated with a family of probability distributions P(t x) on assignments t, parameterized by arguments x, and a second family of distributions Q(t u x) on assignments t parameterized by partial assignment u and arguments x. Q is called the internal proposal family of the generative function, and satisfies that if u and t agree then P(t x)  0 if and only if Q(t x u)  0, and that Q(t x u)  0 implies that u and t agree.

Non-addressable random choices manifest to the user of the interface as stochasticity in weights returned by generative function interface methods. The behavior of non-addressable random choices is defined by an additional pair of families of distributions associated with the generative function, denoted Q(r x t) and P(r x t), which are defined for P(t x)  0, and which satisfy Q(r x t)  0 if and only if P(r x t)  0. For each generative function below, we describe its semantics first in the basic setting where there is no non-addressable random choices, and then in the more general setting that may include non-addressable random choices."

    "text": "Generative functions may support computation of gradients with respect to (i) all or a subset of its arguments, (ii) its trainable parameters, and (iii) the value of certain random choices. The set of elements (either arguments, trainable parameters, or random choices) for which gradients are available is called the gradient source set. A generative function statically reports whether or not it is able to compute gradients with respect to each of its arguments, through the function has_argument_grads. Let x_G denote the set of arguments for which the generative function does support gradient computation. Similarly, a generative function supports gradients with respect the value of random choices made at all or a subset of addresses. If the return value of the function is conditionally independent of each element in the gradient source set given the other elements in the gradient source set and values of all other random choices, for all possible traces of the function, then the generative function requires a return value gradient to compute gradients with respect to elements of the gradient source set. This static property of the generative function is reported by accepts_output_grad."
