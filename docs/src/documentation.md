## Assignment

### Static Assignment

A `StaticAssignment` contains only symbols as its keys for leaf nodes and for internal nodes.
A `StaticAssignment` has type parameters`R` and `T` that are tuples of `Symbol`s that are the keys of the leaf nodes and internal nodes respectively, so that code can be generated that is specialized to the particular set of keys in the trie:

```julia
struct StaticAssignment{R,S,T,U} <: Assignment
    leaf_nodes::NamedTuple{R,S}
    internal_nodes::NamedTuple{T,U}
end 
```

A `StaticAssignment` with leaf symbols `:a` and `:b` and internal key `:c` can be constructed using syntax like:
```julia
trie = StaticAssignment((a=1, b=2), (c=inner_trie,))
```


## Distributions

Probability distributions are singleton types whose supertype is `Distribution{T}`, where `T` indicates the data type of the random sample.

```julia
abstract type Distribution{T} end
```

By convention, distributions have a global constant lower-case name for the singleton value.
For example:

```julia
struct Bernoulli <: Distribution{Bool} end
const bernoulli = Bernoulli()
```

Distributions must implement two methods, `random` and `logpdf`.

`random` returns a random sample from the distribution:

```julia
x::Bool = random(bernoulli, 0.5)
x::Bool = random(Bernoulli(), 0.5)
```

`logpdf` returns the log probability (density) of the distribution at a given value:

```julia
logpdf(bernoulli, false, 0.5)
logpdf(Bernoulli(), false, 0.5)
```

Distribution values are also callable, which is a syntactic sugar with the same behavior of calling `random`:

```julia
bernoulli(0.5) # identical to random(bernoulli, 0.5) and random(Bernoulli(), 0.5)
```

Distributions also implement a `get_static_argument_types` method, which provide concrete types for the arguments.
This method is used by the Gen compiler.

### Gradients of Distributions

Distributions may also implement `logpdf_grad`, which returns the gradient of the log probability (density) with respect to the random sample and the parameters, as a tuple:

```julia
(grad_sample, grad_mu, grad_std) = logpdf_grad(normal, 1.324, 0.0, 1.0)
```

The partial derivative of the log probability (density) with respect to the random sample, or one of the parameters, might not always exist.
Distributions indicate which partial derivatives exist using the methods `has_output_grad` and `has_argument_grads`:

```julia
has_output_grad(::Normal) = true
has_argument_grads(::Normal) = (true, true)
```

If a particular partial derivative does not exist, that field of the tuple returned by `logpdf_grad` should be `nothing`.
