# Assignments

An *assignment* is a map from addresses of random choices to their values.
Assignments are constructed by users to express observations and/or constraints on the traces of generative functions.
Assignments are also returned by certain Gen inference methods, and are used internally by various Gen inference methods.

There are various concrete types for assignments, each of which is a subtype of `Assignment`.
Assignments provide the following methods:
```@docs
has_value
get_value
get_subassmt
get_values_shallow
get_subassmts_shallow
to_array
from_array
```
Note that none of these methods mutate the assignment.

Assignments also provide `Base.isempty`, which tests of there are no random
choices in the assignment, and `Base.merge`, which takes two assignments, and
returns a new assignment containing all random choices in either assignment.
It is an error if the assignments both have values at the same address, or if
one assignment has a value at an address that is the prefix of the address of a
value in the other assignment.


## Dynamic Assignment

One concrete assignment type is `DynamicAssignment`, which is mutable.
Users construct `DynamicAssignments` and populate them for use as observations or constraints, e.g.:
```julia
assmt = DynamicAssignment()
assmt[:x] = true
assmt["foo"] = 1.25
assmt[:y => 1 => :z] = -6.3
```

```@docs
DynamicAssignment
set_value!
set_subassmt!
```
