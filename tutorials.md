The pages below contain tutorials on different features of Gen.
These tutorials were generated from Jupyter notebooks, which are available as part of a Docker container, at [Gen Quickstart](https://github.com/probcomp/gen-quickstart).

## [A Bottom-up Introduction to Gen](../bottom-up/A Bottom-Up Introduction to Gen)
This tutorial describes the reasoning behind some of the basic concepts in Gen.

## [Scaling with Combinators and the Static Modeling Language](../scaling-with-combinators/Scaling with Combinators and the Static Modeling Language)
This tutorial shows how generative function combinators and the static modeling language are used to achieve good asymptotic scaling time of inference algorithms.

## [Particle Filtering in Gen](../particle-filtering-in-gen/Particle Filtering in Gen)
This tutorial shows how to implement a particle filter for tracking the location of an object from measurements of its relative bearing.

## [Reasoning about Regenerate](../Reasoning+About+Regenerate)
This tutorial explains some of the mathematical details of MCMC in Gen.
